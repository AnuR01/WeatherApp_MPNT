# WeatherApp_MPNT

I have created a Weather Application, which fetches the live weather data from openWeater Api.The application gives the
temperature, humidity and wind speed of the location searched for.

Steps to run the Weather Application: 
- Clone the repository to your android studio.
- Do not upgrade the project, as it will make or cause the program run into dependencies problems.
(NOTE: Ignore the "Do Not upgrade the project" notification that will come when running this project)
- Then go to " MainActivity.kt" file and run the emulator.
- The API that is used is openWeather Api, and it is already available in code. So, nothing needs to be done about that.
- Search city name in the search bar on top, and press on the search button.


Reference: While working on this project, so I have used several sources like Google, youtube videos, and stackoverflow to solve my erros.
I used youtube videos, google to solve and add speicific features that I wanted in the apllication from openWeather Api.
